# Design Components library

Design Components (DC) are defined as reusable front-end elements that can be interchanged based on the instance of the Workstation Framework. The library url is defined in the system layout, so the correct library and version is loaded. DCs will not have any back-end functionality.

The library of DCs will be controlled by the WF and passed to the WCs with the configuration from the system layout. There will be integration instructions for the WCs to integrate a DC. Every DC will have a predefined tag to instantiate the web component described in the integration instructions.
